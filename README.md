# LibCrayonVmu

A library form of Protofall's VmuDeCrayonised example. You can find the original @ https://gitlab.com/Protofall/Homebrew-Tests/-/tree/master/KallistiOSTests/VmuExample-DeCrayonised

Protofall has stated he won't be maintaining that version of the program anymore in favour of his newer system @ https://gitlab.com/Protofall/Crayon-Savefile , so this repository contains the most up-to-date version of the old system.
